# dojot-UI

In this repository, all the new front-end applications associated with the Dojot project are implemented. Aiming a better maintenance of our Dojot's Graphical User Interfaces, we choose to store all UI applications in this monorepository (<https://github.com/dojot/dojot-ui>) and our goal is to migrate the other services to this one in the future.

## dojot

dojot was conceived with the goal of developing and demonstrating technologies for smart cities. Initially focusing on the pillars of public safety, urban mobility and health. It intends to build a multidisciplinary ecosystem in these areas.

dojot is a Brazilian IoT Platform that came up with an open source proposal in order to facilitate the development of solutions and the IoT ecosystem with local content focused on Brazilian needs.

The platform is one of the outcomes of the project "Plataforma Aberta para IoT e suas Aplicações", which is supported by FUNTTEL via [Finep](http://www.finep.gov.br/), and led  by [CPqD](https://www.cpqd.com.br/en/), its main executor, in partnership with other science and technology institutions: [Instituto Atlântico](http://www.atlantico.com.br/?lang=en), [Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer - CTI](https://www.cti.gov.br/en), and [Fundação de Apoio à Capacitação em Tecnologia da Informação - FACTI](https://facti.com.br/).
